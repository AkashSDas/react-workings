// useId is a React Hook for generating unique IDs that can be passed to
// accessibility attributes.

// With server rendering, useId requires an identical component tree on the server and
// the client. If the trees you render on the server and the client don’t match
// exactly, the generated IDs won’t match.

// You might be wondering why useId is better than incrementing a global variable like nextId++.
//
// The primary benefit of useId is that React ensures that it works with server rendering.
// During server rendering, your components generate HTML output. Later, on the client,
// hydration attaches your event handlers to the generated HTML. For hydration to work,
// the client output must match the server HTML.
//
// The primary benefit of useId is that React ensures that it works with server rendering.
// This is very difficult to guarantee with an incrementing counter because the order
// in which the Client Components are hydrated may not match the order in which the server HTML
// was emitted. By calling useId, you ensure that hydration will work, and the output will
// match between the server and the client.
//
// Inside React, useId is generated from the “parent path” of the calling component. This
// is why, if the client and the server tree are the same, the “parent path” will match up
// regardless of rendering order.

export default function UseId(): JSX.Element {
    var usernameHintId = useId();
